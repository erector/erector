## Description

Erector is a Builder-like view framework, inspired by Markaby but overcoming
some of its flaws. In Erector all views are objects, not template files, which
allows the full power of object-oriented programming (inheritance, modular
decomposition, encapsulation) in views. See [the rdoc for the `Erector::Widget`
class](http://erector.rubyforge.org/rdoc/Erector/Widget.html) to learn how to make your own widgets, and visit the
[project site](http://erector.rubyforge.org/) for more documentation.

No, seriously, we've got hella docs at
[http://erector.rubyforge.org](http://erector.rubyforge.org) -- go check it out.

## Synopsis

```ruby

    require 'erector'

    class Hello < Erector::Widget
      def content
        html do
          head do
            title "Hello"
          end
          body do
            text "Hello, "
            b @target, :class => 'big'
            text "!"
          end
        end
      end
    end

    Hello.new(:target => 'world').to_html
    => "<html><head><title>Hello</title></head><body>Hello, <b class=\"big\">world</b>!</body></html>"

```

```ruby

    include Erector::Mixin
    erector { div "love", :class => "big" }
    => "<div class=\"big\">love</div>"

```

## Requirements

The gem depends on `rake` and `treetop`, although this is just for using the
command-line tool, so deployed applications won't need these. The
Rails-dependent code is now separated so you can use Erector cleanly in a
non-Rails app.

## Installation

To install as a gem:

* `sudo gem install erector`

Then add `require 'erector'` to any files which need erector.

To install as a Rails plugin:

* Copy the erector source to `vendor/plugins/erector` in your Rails directory.

When installing this way, erector is automatically available to your Rails code
(no require directive is needed).

## Tests

Three spec rake tasks are provided:

* `spec:core` (core functionality);
* `spec:erect` (the erector command line tool); and
* `spec:rails` (Rails integration).

`rake spec` will run the complete set of specs.
