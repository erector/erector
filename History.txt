===
* Erector can now pretty-print the generated HTML to make it easier to read.

=== 0.4.191 / 2008-07-29
* Renamed HtmlParts to Doc
* Widget#doc is now a HtmlParts which proxies to the passed in IO stream
* Better compatibility with standard Rails rendering because ActionController::Base#render and #render_widget now have the Widget write directly to _erbout.
* ActionView::Base objects run with Erector now receive all of the instance variables
* Erector works with erb layouts
* Deprecate fake_erbout
* Better handling for file with .html.rb extension.
* Fix overwriting issue when using Rails helpers
* New method Widget#character
* Widget#nbsp without arguments now outputs a single non-breaking space.

=== 0.3.110 / 2008-05-29

* support capture from rails helpers, allowing form_for/form_tag to work right
* fix bug in view_paths support (finding views was hosed)

=== 0.3.105 / 2008-05-29

* Lots of changes to support Rails integration better.
* Add partial support for render :partial.
* More Rails helpers proxies added to helpers.rb.
* Fake erbouts can now nest, allowing better support for Rails helpers like form_for (though they're currently capped at 10 deep to head off infinite regress).
* Rails finds both .rb and .html.rb files inside the app/views directories.
* Use Rails view_paths instead of hardcoded RAILS_ROOT/app/views (patch by Rami Grossman)
* add 'url' and 'css' convenience methods to Widget

=== 0.2.83 / 2008-04-23

* "erect" supports command-line options
* "erect" now works backwards -- you can output static html from a widget.rb file
* The web site is generated from erector classes (still pretty minimal though)

=== 0.2.61 / 2008-04-18

* Improvements to "erect"
  * works on HTML attributes (including namespaced attributes and hyphenated attributes)
  * works on directories (recursively looking for .html and .html.erb and .rhtml files)
  * converts DOCTYPE nodes
  * deals with HTML entities inside text and attributes

=== 0.2.54 / 2008-04-15

* New script "erect" to convert (some) .html.erb files into erector classes.

=== 0.2.42 / 2008-04-11

* Rails Controller now can render Erector widgets using #render
* Erector views can live inside Rails "app/views" directory, just like other views

=== 0.1.25 / 2008-02-26

* nbsp method
* :class => ['one', 'two']  (that is, passing an array rather than a string)
... perhaps one or two I forgot.
* rename tag to element
* add empty_element feature
* for the built-in HTML tags, knows which ones should be empty and which shouldn't be.
  For example, generates `<input />` rather than `<input></input>`
* text and attributes are quoted by default; call raw to avoid this
* h is rarely necessary now, but it returns a string rather than appending to the buffer
* nbsp method turns spaces into non-breaking spaces
* sending in an array for attribute values (typically CSS classes) concatenates them separated by spaces
* The column definition name can be a Proc that gets executed.
* Renamed instruct! to instruct (old one remains as a deprecated method for now), as it is no more side-effecting (or dangerous or whatever) than any other method in Widget.

=== 0.1.0 / 2008-02-13

* First public release

=== 0.0.1

* Was on pivotalrb.rubyforge.org
