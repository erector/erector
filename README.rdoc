== DESCRIPTION

Erector is a Builder-like view framework, inspired by Markaby but overcoming
some of its flaws. In Erector all views are objects, not template files,
which allows the full power of object-oriented programming (inheritance,
modular decomposition, encapsulation) in views. See the rdoc for the
Erector::Widget class to learn how to make your own widgets, and visit the
project site at http://erector.rubyforge.org for more documentation.

No, seriously, we've got hella docs at http://erector.rubyforge.org -- go
check it out.

== SYNOPSIS

    require 'erector'

    class Hello < Erector::Widget
      def content
        html do
          head do
            title "Hello"
          end
          body do
            text "Hello, "
            b @target, :class => 'big'
            text "!"
          end
        end
      end
    end

    Hello.new(:target => 'world').to_html
    => "<html><head><title>Hello</title></head><body>Hello, <b class=\"big\">world</b>!</body></html>"

    include Erector::Mixin
    erector { div "love", :class => "big" }
    => "<div class=\"big\">love</div>"

== REQUIREMENTS

The gem depends on rake and treetop, although this is just for using the command-line tool,
so deployed applications won't need these. The Rails-dependent code is now separated so
you can use Erector cleanly in a non-Rails app.

== INSTALL

To install as a gem:

* sudo gem install erector

Then add "require 'erector'" to any files which need erector.

To install as a Rails plugin:

* Copy the erector source to vendor/plugins/erector in your Rails directory.

When installing this way, erector is automatically available to your Rails code
(no require directive is needed).

== TESTS

Three spec rake tasks are provided: spec:core (core functionality),
spec:erect (the erector command line tool), and spec:rails (rails integration).

'rake spec' will run the complete set of specs.
