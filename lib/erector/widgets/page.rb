# Erector Page base class.
#
# Allows for accumulation of script and style tags (see example below) with
# either external or inline content. External references are 'uniq'd, so it's
# a good idea to declare a js script in all widgets that use it, so you don't
# accidentally lose the script if you remove the one widget that happened to
# declare it.
#
# The script and style declarations are accumulated at class load time, as
# 'dependencies'. This technique allows all widgets to add their own
# requirements to the page header without extra logic for declaring which
# pages include which nested widgets. Fortunately, Page is now smart enough to
# figure out which widgets were actually rendered during the body_content run,
# so it only emits into its HEAD the dependencies that are relevant. If it
# misses some, or if you want to add some extra dependencies -- for instance,
# styles that apply to widgets that are rendered later via AJAX -- then return
# an array of those widget classes in your subclass by overriding the
# #extra_widgets method.
#
# If you want something to show up in the headers for just one page type
# (subclass), then override #head_content, call super, and then emit it
# yourself.
#
# Body content can be supplied in several ways:
#
#   * In a Page subclass, by overriding the #body_content method:
#
#      class MyPage < Erector::Widgets::Page
#        def body_content
#          text "body content"
#        end
#      end
#
#   * Or by overriding #content and passing a block to super:
#
#      class MyPage < Erector::Widgets::Page
#        def content
#          super do
#            text "body content"
#          end
#        end
#      end
#
#   * Or by passing a block to Page.new:
#
#      Erector::Widgets::Page.new do
#        text "body content"
#      end
#
# This last trick (passing a block to Page.new) works because Page is an
# InlineWidget so its block is evaluated in the context of the newly
# instantiated widget object, and not in the context of its caller. But this
# means you can't access instance variables of the caller, e.g.
#
#      @name = "fred"
#      Erector::Widgets::Page.new do
#        text "my name is #{@name}"
#      end
#
# will emit "my name is " because @name is nil inside the new Page. However,
# you *can* call methods in the parent class, thanks to some method_missing
# magic. Confused? You should be. See Erector::Inline#content for more
# documentation.

# = Example Usage: 
#
#   class MyPage < Page
#     external :js, "lib/jquery.js"
#     external :script, "$(document).ready(function(){...});"
#     external :css, "stuff.css"
#     external :style, "li.foo { color: red; }"
#
#     def page_title
#       "my app"
#     end
#
#     def body_content
#       h1 "My App"
#       p "welcome to my app"
#       widget WidgetWithExternalStyle
#     end
#   end
#
#   class WidgetWithExternalStyle < Erector::Widget
#     external :style, "div.custom { border: 2px solid green; }"
#
#     def content
#       div :class => "custom" do
#         text "green is good"
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
# = Thoughts:
#  * It may be desirable to unify #js and #script, and #css and #style, and
#    have the routine be smart enough to analyze its parameter to decide
#    whether to make it a file or a script.
