    # indentation:: the amount of spaces to indent. Ignored unless prettyprint
    #               is true.
    # max_length:: preferred maximum length of a line. Line wraps will only
    #              occur at space characters, so a long word may end up
    #              creating a line longer than this. If nil (default), then

    #              internal newline characters and prettyprinting will
    #              determine newlines in the output.
    # helpers:: a helpers object containing utility methods. Usually this is a
    #           Rails view object.
